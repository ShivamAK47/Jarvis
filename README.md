Overview
<br>
JARVIS (Just A Rather Very Intelligent System) is an intelligent virtual assistant designed to interact with users via voice commands or text inputs. It uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to perform various tasks, provide useful information, and streamline daily routines. JARVIS is inspired by Tony Starkâ€™s AI assistant from the Marvel universe and aims to bring a similar experience to real-life users.
